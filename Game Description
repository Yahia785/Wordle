Description: 

This application is a two-player word-guessing game in which one player enters a word and the other player has six attempts to guess it. The player making the guess receives feedback on each attempt, indicating whether the guessed letter is present in the word and whether it is in the correct position. The game terminates either when the guesser exhausts their attempts or when they correctly guess the word.
Upon starting the program, the title screen appears automatically. From this screen, player 1 is prompted to begin typing in order to initiate the game. Once player 1 commences typing, the screen switches to the word creation interface, which displays the word as it is typed. After a five-letter word has been entered, pressing button 1 transitions the screen to the word-guessing interface, enabling player 2 to commence making guesses. After entering a five-letter guess, pressing button 1 submits the guess and provides feedback to player 2. Upon reaching the maximum of six guesses or correctly guessing the word, the screen switches to the end screen, displaying the result of the game.
